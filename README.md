# Earthquakes_Challenge

# Module 13 Challenge-

This written analysis contains two sections:

**1. Overview of Project**

**2. Results**

## 1. Overview of the analysis

The aim of the analysis was to help Basil and Sadhana see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth. Further, they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

The analysis involved Leaflet plots and involveing GeoJSON to pull together the maps
## 2. Results

The results primarily highlights the following outputs,

a: Add Tectonic Plate Data
b: Add Major Earthquake Data
c: Add an Additional Map base layer

### **a. Unfiltered view of the webpage:**

The first step is to understand the layout of the webpage as shown in the image below. The entire unfiltered layers  are shown below,

*a. Unfiltered Webpage with base Streets Layer*
